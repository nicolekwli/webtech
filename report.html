<!--Your report should give your estimated grades under each heading, and then
    list things you've done under each heading to justify the estimate. You might
    also want to explain your overall aims and design, mention anything you are
    particularly proud of, anything I might miss when I am browsing your site,
    and anything which took a substantial amount of time and effort but didn't
    make it into the site.-->

    <p>
        An SPA with the aim to improve user experience through a more modern look(?), a more interactive design and reduced loading time. We also
        aim to understand frontend more so we did not use any frontend frameworks and wrote our own router and template module.

    <h2>Server</h2>
    <p>Our server uses express, and all the code uses the modern <code>async/await</code> style. It runs both on HTTP (port 8080) and HTTPS (port 8443). The HTTPS certificate is self-signed as the server is not hosted on a domain.
       Cookies are used for login sessions, with the option of expiring with the browser session or after 7 days if the 'remember me' box is checked. The helmet package
       was used to set appropriate HTTP headers for security. Cookies are set to HttpOnly, and secure (if on HTTPS).
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>Our database uses SQLite. A create/drop script (/database/create.sql) can be used to reset the database, and a Node script (/database/init_db.js) can be run to populate it with test values.
       All databases accesses are done via a module (/database/database.js).
