<!--Your report should give your estimated grades under each heading, and then
    list things you've done under each heading to justify the estimate. You might
    also want to explain your overall aims and design, mention anything you are
    particularly proud of, anything I might miss when I am browsing your site,
    and anything which took a substantial amount of time and effort but didn't
    make it into the site.-->

    <p>
        An SPA of a ticketing website with the aim to improve user experience through a more modern look(?), a more interactive design and reduced loading time. We also
        aim to understand frontend development more so we did not use any frontend frameworks and wrote our own router and template module, animation and designs.

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Some text about HTML</p>
    <p>XHTML</p>
    <p>Structured for responsive convenience(?)</p>
    <p></p>
    <br/>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>Some text about CSS</p>
    <p>Animation with css. Responsiveness with css. Parallax effect with css. Transitions with css.  </p>

    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p>Some text about JS</p>
    <p>
        Did not use any frontend frameworks, implemented our own router and template module.
        The router performs client-side routing for the SPA. 
            Initialising the router would populate an array of routes with parameters like uri, callback, parameters, regular expression etc.
            The router then matches the current pathname and parameters to the corresponding route and displays the corresponding content.
            The router also handles more complex pathnames using .where() with regular expressions that for each parameter. This is implemented for each individual show page. for e.g. http://localhost:8080/shows/1
        Modify browser history states so its possible to navigate to previous page using the browser back button.
        Animation and interaction done with js, for example:
            svgs outline path drawing, 
            smooth scrolls, 
            page transitions, 
            selection of seats, 
            search bar,
            carousel navigation,
            everything.
        The hiding of navbar when scrolling downwards on the shows and account page, will appear if hovered over and when scrolled upwards.
    .</p>

    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>Some text about PNG</p>
    <p> 
        Created our own "Silence of the Lambdas" banner and poster.
        Created some of our own icons (?).
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>Some text about SVG</p>
    <p>
        All svgs in the img folder are created using inkscape and user interactions and animations with them are done with js and css for some styling.
        There are also svgs created in the htmls, including the splash screen, carousel navigations and these animations and interactions are done with css and js.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Server</h2>
    <p>Our server uses express, and all the code uses the modern <code>async/await</code> style. It runs both on HTTP (port 8080) and HTTPS (port 8443). The HTTPS certificate is self-signed as the server is not hosted on a domain.
       Cookies are used for login sessions, with the option of expiring with the browser session or after 7 days if the 'remember me' box is checked. The helmet package
       was used to set appropriate HTTP headers for security. Cookies are set to HttpOnly, and secure (if on HTTPS).
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Database</h2>
    <p>Our database uses SQLite. A create/drop script (/database/create.sql) can be used to reset the database, and a Node script (/database/init_db.js) can be run to populate it with test values.
       All databases accesses are done via a module (/database/database.js).
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Dynamic pages</h2>
    <p>Some text about Dynamic pages</p>
    <p>
        We implemented our own template rendering module to deliver dynamic content:
            We request data from the server and insert them into existing templates on the client side using the template module. 
            The module finds the template with the corresponding id and matches {{something something sometihng}}, this way we do not need to write code for every insertion of data. (?Need words)
            It also deals with insertion of the same template but with different data.
