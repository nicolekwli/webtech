<!--Your report should give your estimated grades under each heading, and then
    list things you've done under each heading to justify the estimate. You might
    also want to explain your overall aims and design, mention anything you are
    particularly proud of, anything I might miss when I am browsing your site,
    and anything which took a substantial amount of time and effort but didn't
    make it into the site.-->

    <h2>Overall</h2>
    <p>
        An SPA of a ticketing website with the aim to improve user experience with a more interactive design and reduced loading time. We 
        aimed to get a deeper understanding of frontend development so chose not to use any frontend frameworks, and instead wrote our own 
        router and template module, along with creating our own animation and styles.
        On our site, Tick.et, you can browse through the latest shows, view availability for seats by interacting with the seatmap and then purchase tickets.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>Our HTML is written using the HTML5 standard, and has been validated using the W3C validation service. It has also been validated with XHTML delivery using Chrome.</p>
    <p>XHTML</p>
    <p>Structured for responsive convenience(?)</p>
    <p></p>
    <br/>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
    We created our own animations and transitions with css.
    <br/>
    We created a responsive website.
    <br/>
    Created a custom parallax effect with css for our home page.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>JS</h2>
    <p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>Written in ES5, so that it is friendly to older browsers.</li>
            <li>Did not use any frontend frameworks, implemented our own router and template module.</li>
            <li>Router: performs client-side routing for the SPA.</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '-';">
                <li>Initialising the router would populate an array of routes with parameters like uri, callback, parameters, regular expression etc.</li>
                <li>The router then matches the current pathname and parameters to the corresponding route and displays the corresponding content.</li>
                <li>The router also handles more complex pathnames using .where() with regular expressions for each parameter. This is implemented for each individual show page. for e.g. http://localhost:8080/shows/1</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Modify browser history states so its possible to navigate to previous page using the browser back button.</li>
            <li>The hiding of navbar when scrolling downwards on the shows and account page, will appear if hovered over and when scrolled upwards.</li>
            <li>Animation and interaction was done with js, for example:</li>
            <ul style="list-style-type: '-';">
                <li>Draws the path outline for SVG (seen in the login modal)</li>
                <li>Smooth scrolling effect (show details pages)</li>
                <li>Interacting with the seatmap, including conditional formatting</li>
                <li>Navigating the carousel and indicating the change in banner (home page)</li>
                <li>Fade transitions between the different pages</li>
                <li>Auto-completing search bar (on shows page)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>PNG</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Created our own "<i>Silence of the Lambdas</i>" banner and poster</li>
            <ul>
                <li>GIMP was used to make these</li>
                <li>Lots of layers were used to build up an image</li>
                <li>GIMP's inbuilt filters were used to make the image look interesting without requiring any artistic talent</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Created some of our own icons (?)</li>
        </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>Some text about SVG</p>
    <p>
        All SVGs in the img folder are created using inkscape. User interaction and animations with them are done in JS and CSS for styling.
        We also created some SVGs in the HTML, including the splash screen, carousel navigations and legend for seatmap. The animations and interactions for this were also done with CSS and JS.
    </p>
    <br/>

    <h2>Server</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Written using express.js</li>
        <li>Uses the code uses the modern <code>async/await</code> style</li>
        <li>Runs both on HTTP (port 8080) and HTTPS (port 8443)</li>
        <li>HTTPS certificate is self-signed as the server is not hosted on a domain</li>
        <li>Cookies are used for login sessions, with the option of </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Cookies expire with the browser session, or after 7 days if the 'remember me' box is checked</li>
            <li>Cookies are set to <i>HttpOnly</i>, and <i>secure</i> (if on HTTPS)</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The <i>helmet</i> package was used to set appropriate HTTP headers for security</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>

    <h2>Database</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>We use a integrated SQLite database</li>
        <li>When the server starts, it checks if the database file exists, and if not creates and initialises it</li>
        <li>We wrote a database.js module, which provides many functions to help access the database</li>
        <li>The <code>create.sql</code> script shows the structure of the database. We tried to stick to proper normal form</li>
    </ul>
    Our database uses SQLite. . 
    <br/>

    <h2>Dynamic pages</h2>
    <p>
        We implemented our own template rendering module to deliver dynamic content:
        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
            <li>We request data from the server and insert them into existing templates on the client side using the template module. </li>
            <li>The module finds the template with the corresponding id and matches {{something something sometihng}}, this way we do not need to write code for every insertion of data. (?Need words)</li>
            <li>It also deals with insertion of the same template but with different data.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
