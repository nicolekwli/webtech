<!--Your report should give your estimated grades under each heading, and then
    list things you've done under each heading to justify the estimate. You might
    also want to explain your overall aims and design, mention anything you are
    particularly proud of, anything I might miss when I am browsing your site,
    and anything which took a substantial amount of time and effort but didn't
    make it into the site.-->

        An SPA with the aim to improve user experience through a more modern look(?), a more interactive design and reduced loading time. We also
        aim to understand frontend more so we did not use any frontend frameworks and wrote our own router and template module.
