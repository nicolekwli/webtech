### NOTES:
_im gonna add notes here to come back to so we don't forget_  
* **Using Express**: In the server lab Ian points out that there can be a huge security vulnerability while using Express (beign able to access the admin page thru browser). So we just need to be careful.

* All validators here:

* I think ian talked about var vs consts somewhere (cant find it so have ignored thinking about that for now)

### THinsg ive done
(_things ive done cos it may look like a mess:_  ___(because it is a mess)___)  

**what is website_form**  
-so in folder *website_form* is a website(?) of a form asking for name & email that i made following a tutorial basically to learn things.  
-the gist is its a node-express server, with pug templating engine, and bootstrap for frontend css.  
-to run it cd into the directory and then: ```npm run watch```. it should show up on ```localhost:3000```.  
-the file _create.js_ is to create a random database called humans with fields name and email.
-tried to make the form 

**what is our_site**  
this is our actual site. :P
-has ians server with pug templating, and bootstrap css  
-have created a database thats for animals 
-to start our server is also the same, run ```npm run watch```, and go to ```localhost:8080```. (in our case it watches the file server.js) 


### TO DO:
- create a new server
- create the databases
- create a homepage
