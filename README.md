### NOTES:
_im gonna add notes here to come back to so we don't forget_  
* **Using Express**: In the server lab Ian points out that there can be a huge security vulnerability while using Express (beign able to access the admin page thru browser). So we just need to be careful.

WAIT im confused. if server is already given, we dont need express? :O
or maybe we get more marks if we build our own server? lol what

* All validators here:

* I think ian talked about var vs consts somewhere (cant find it so have ignored thinking about that for now)

### THinsg ive done
_things ive done cos it may look like a mess:_  
ive ignored ians server for now.
set up a server thing with express - app.js, start.js, index.js
runs on port :80 to differentiate from ians server which is on 8080
